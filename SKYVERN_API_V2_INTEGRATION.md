# Skyvern API v2 Integration Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the integration of Skyvern API v2 into the TSautomation system. The integration ensures that the system uses the latest Skyvern API version by default, providing improved performance, reliability, and security.

## Changes Made

### Code Changes

1. **Updated Authentication Handlers**:
   - Modified `skyvern-integration.ts` to use the v2 auth handler by default
   - Updated `dynamic-skyvern.ts` to use the v2 auth handler for all API calls
   - Added configuration option to control which API version to use

2. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Added `USE_V2_API=true` to the `.env` file to enable API v2 by default
   - Ensured both API key and Bearer token authentication methods are supported
   - Updated API URL configuration to properly point to v2 endpoints

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Updated `README.md` to document the API v2 integration
   - Created `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` with guidance for common issues
   - Updated `DEPLOYMENT.md` with instructions for configuring and using API v2

## Testing Results

The integration was thoroughly tested to ensure compatibility and functionality:

1. **API Health Check**:
   - Confirmed that the API v2 health endpoint is accessible
   - Verified that the health check returns the correct status

2. **Authentication Testing**:
   - Tested API key authentication
   - Tested Bearer token authentication
   - Tested combined authentication (both API key and Bearer token)
   - Verified that authentication works correctly for both v1 and v2 APIs

3. **Task Creation and Management**:
   - Successfully created tasks using the API v2 endpoint
   - Verified that task status can be retrieved correctly
   - Confirmed that the task processing workflow functions as expected

## Benefits

The integration of Skyvern API v2 provides several benefits:

1. **Improved Performance**:
   - API v2 offers better performance and reduced latency
   - Enhanced caching mechanisms improve response times

2. **Enhanced Reliability**:
   - More robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
   - Better handling of network issues and timeouts

3. **Advanced Authentication**:
   - Support for multiple authentication methods
   - Improved security with Bearer token authentication

4. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - The system can still fall back to API v1 if needed
   - Legacy code continues to function with minimal changes

## Configuration Options

The following environment variables control the API version and authentication:

```
# API Version Configuration
USE_V2_API=true  # Set to false to use API v1

# API URLs for different versions
SKYVERN_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
SKYVERN_API_V2_URL=http://localhost

# Authentication Methods
SKYVERN_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
SKYVERN_BEARER_TOKEN=your_bearer_token_here
```

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

1. **Authentication Errors (401/403)**:
   - Verify that both API key and Bearer token are correctly set in `.env`
   - Ensure that the API URLs are correctly configured
   - Check that the Skyvern service is running and accessible

2. **Method Not Allowed Errors (405)**:
   - Ensure you're using the correct HTTP method for each endpoint
   - Verify that the endpoint path is correct for the API version

3. **API Version Confusion**:
   - Check the `USE_V2_API` setting in your `.env` file
   - Verify that the code is using the correct auth handler

For more detailed troubleshooting guidance, refer to the `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` document.

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements to the API v2 integration:

1. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Add telemetry to track API performance metrics
   - Implement automatic fallback to v1 if v2 performance degrades

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Develop more sophisticated error recovery strategies
   - Implement circuit breaker patterns for API calls

3. **Authentication Enhancements**:
   - Support for OAuth 2.0 authentication
   - Implement token refresh mechanisms

## Accessing the Skyvern UI

To access the Skyvern UI, use the following URL:

```
http://localhost/skyvern/
```

If you encounter any of the following issues:

1. **"Blocked request" error with the message "This host ("skyvernui") is not allowed"**:
   - The Vite configuration has been updated to allow the "skyvernui" host in `skyvern-frontend/vite.config.ts`
   - The Skyvern UI container has been rebuilt to apply these changes

2. **403 Forbidden error when accessing the Skyvern UI**:
   - The Nginx configuration has been updated to use the correct Host header
   - In `nginx/conf.d/default.conf`, we changed `proxy_set_header Host skyvernui:3000;` to `proxy_set_header Host $host;`
   - The Nginx container has been restarted to apply these changes

3. **Links in the Skyvern UI not working**:
   - Fixed by updating the Nginx configuration to properly handle the base URL
   - Added a base tag in the HTML head: `sub_filter '<head>' '<head><base href="/skyvern/">';`
   - Updated the sub_filter directives to handle URLs correctly:
     ```
     sub_filter 'href="/' 'href="';
     sub_filter 'src="/' 'src="';
     sub_filter 'url(/' 'url(';
     ```
   - Added `base: '/skyvern/'` to the Vite configuration in `skyvern-frontend/vite.config.ts`

These changes ensure that the Skyvern UI is accessible through the correct URL and that the API v2 is working properly.

## Recent Updates and Fixes

### UI Link Issues

We identified and fixed issues with the Skyvern UI links not working properly. The following changes were made:

1. **Updated Base Path Configuration**:
   - Added a `<base href="/skyvern/">` tag directly in the `skyvern-frontend/index.html` file
   - Moved the `base` configuration to the root level in `vite.config.ts` instead of under the server section
   - Added a specific proxy configuration for `/api/v2` in the Vite configuration

2. **Improved Nginx Configuration**:
   - Updated the sub_filter directives to properly handle URLs:
     ```
     sub_filter 'href="/' 'href="/skyvern/';
     sub_filter 'src="/' 'src="/skyvern/';
     sub_filter 'url(/' 'url(/skyvern/';
     ```
   - Fixed the API proxy configuration to ensure proper routing

3. **Docker Environment Variables**:
   - Added `VITE_BASE_PATH=/skyvern/` to the skyvernui service in docker-compose.yml
   - Updated `VITE_SKYVERN_API_URL` to point to the v2 API endpoint

### Testing Tools

We've created new testing tools to verify the Skyvern API v2 integration:

1. **test-skyvern-v2.js**:
   - Tests API v2 connectivity with both API key and Bearer token authentication
   - Verifies task creation and status retrieval functionality
   - Provides detailed logging and test results

2. **Container Restart Scripts**:
   - Created `restart-containers.sh` (Linux/macOS) and `restart-containers.bat` (Windows)
   - These scripts stop, rebuild, and restart the necessary containers to apply configuration changes
   - Includes proper waiting periods and status checks

## Conclusion

The Skyvern API v2 integration is now complete and fully functional. The system defaults to using API v2 for all operations, with the option to fall back to v1 if needed. This integration ensures that TSautomation remains compatible with the latest Skyvern features and benefits from improved performance and reliability.

With the recent fixes to the UI link issues and the addition of comprehensive testing tools, the system is now more robust and user-friendly. The Skyvern UI is fully accessible and functional, and the API v2 integration has been thoroughly tested and verified.
