# TSautomation Docker Setup Summary

## Overview

This document provides a summary of the Docker setup implemented for the TSautomation system. The setup is designed to facilitate local development, testing, and easy migration to remote servers or VPS environments.

## Files Created

1. **Dockerfile**
   - Based on the official Playwright image
   - Includes all necessary dependencies
   - Configures a non-root user for security
   - Sets up environment variables for headless operation

2. **docker-compose.yml**
   - Orchestrates multiple services:
     - `automation`: The main TSautomation service
     - `skyvern`: AI-powered visual automation service
     - `postgres`: Database for Skyvern
     - `nginx`: Reverse proxy for secure access

3. **Nginx Configuration**
   - `nginx/conf.d/default.conf`: Configures the reverse proxy
   - Implements SSL for secure communication
   - Sets up routes for different services

4. **SSL Certificate Generation**
   - `generate-ssl-certs.sh`: For Linux/macOS
   - `generate-ssl-certs.bat`: For Windows
   - Creates self-signed certificates for local development

5. **Environment Testing**
   - `test-environment.js`: Tests the Docker environment
   - Verifies connectivity to Skyvern
   - Tests browser automation
   - Validates internet access
   - Checks OpenAI API connectivity

6. **Startup Scripts**
   - `start-docker-environment.sh`: For Linux/macOS
   - `start-docker-environment.bat`: For Windows
   - Automates the setup and testing process

7. **Documentation**
   - `DEPLOYMENT.md`: Detailed deployment instructions
   - Updated `README.md`: Includes Docker setup information

## Architecture

The Docker setup implements a multi-container architecture:

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐

└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
```

- **Nginx** serves as the entry point, providing SSL termination and routing
- **Automation** service runs the TSautomation code with Playwright
- **Skyvern** provides AI-powered visual automation capabilities
- **PostgreSQL** stores data for Skyvern

All services are connected via a Docker network, allowing them to communicate securely.

## Resource Management

The Docker Compose configuration includes resource limits to prevent container resource starvation:

```yaml
deploy:
  resources:
    limits:
      cpus: '2'
      memory: 4G
```

These limits can be adjusted based on the host system's capabilities.

## Data Persistence

The setup includes volume mounts for persistent data:

- `./logs:/app/logs`: Preserves automation logs
- `./skyvern-data:/data`: Stores Skyvern data
- `postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data`: Persists database data

## Security Considerations

1. **Non-root User**: The automation container runs as a non-root user
2. **SSL Encryption**: All traffic is encrypted using SSL
3. **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data is stored in environment variables
4. **Network Isolation**: Services communicate over an isolated Docker network

## Local Development vs. Production

For local development:
- Self-signed SSL certificates are used
- All services run on a single host
- Resource limits are conservative

For production deployment:
- Use proper SSL certificates from a trusted CA
- Consider distributing services across multiple hosts if needed
- Adjust resource limits based on workload
- Implement monitoring and alerting
- Set up regular backups

## Migration Path

The Docker setup facilitates easy migration between environments:

1. Set up Docker and Docker Compose on the target server
2. Transfer the project files and configuration
3. Configure environment variables for the new environment
4. Run the startup script to deploy the containerized environment

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Thoroughly test the Docker setup in various environments
2. **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring for container health and performance
3. **CI/CD**: Set up continuous integration and deployment pipelines
4. **Scaling**: Explore options for scaling the automation service horizontally
5. **Backup Strategy**: Implement regular backups of persistent data

## Conclusion

The Docker setup provides a robust, secure, and portable environment for running the TSautomation system. It simplifies deployment, ensures consistency across environments, and facilitates future migration to remote servers or VPS environments.
