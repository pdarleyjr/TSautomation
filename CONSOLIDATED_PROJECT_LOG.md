  - V1 API with Bearer token (first fallback)
  - V1 API with API key (second fallback)

- **Robust error handling**:
  - Error categorization (authentication, network, timeout, rate limit, server)
  - Contextual recovery strategies based on error type
  - Comprehensive error logging with request IDs

- **Advanced retry logic**:
  - Exponential backoff with jitter implementation
  - Configurable retry parameters
  - Rate limit awareness

- **Circuit breaker pattern**:
  - Opens circuit after configurable number of consecutive failures
  - Automatic reset after cooling period
  - Failure isolation to prevent cascading failures

- **Enhanced logging and telemetry**:
  - Detailed metrics tracking
  - Request tracing with unique identifiers
  - Session information monitoring

- **Token management**:
  - Automatic token refresh
  - Expiration handling
  - Refresh locking to prevent multiple simultaneous refresh attempts

**Solutions:**

1. Check Docker service status:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   sc query docker
   
   # Linux
   systemctl status docker
   ```

2. Check for port conflicts:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   netstat -ano | findstr "80 443 8000 3000 5432"
   
   # Linux
   netstat -tulpn | grep -E '80|443|8000|3000|5432'
   ```

3. Check Docker logs:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs
   ```

4. Restart Docker:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   restart-service docker
   
   # Linux
   systemctl restart docker
   ```

### Nginx Configuration Issues

#### Nginx Container Restarting

**Symptoms:**
- Nginx container keeps restarting
- Error logs show configuration issues

**Solutions:**

1. Check Nginx logs:
   ```bash
   docker logs tsautomation-main-nginx-1
   ```

2. Fix common Nginx configuration errors:
   - Remove URI parts from `proxy_pass` directives in regular expression locations
   - Fix duplicate MIME types
   - Ensure proper path mapping for Skyvern UI

3. Restart Nginx after fixing configuration:
   ```bash
   docker-compose restart nginx
   ```

### Skyvern API Issues

#### API Not Accessible

**Symptoms:**

- "Connection refused" or "Not Found" errors

**Solutions:**

1. Check if the Skyvern container is running:
   ```bash
   docker ps | grep skyvern
   ```

2. Test direct API access:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/v2/health
   ```

3. Test API access through Nginx proxy:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost/api/v2/health
   ```

4. Check Skyvern API logs:
   ```bash
   docker logs tsautomation-main-skyvern-1
   ```

### Skyvern UI Issues

#### UI Not Accessible

**Symptoms:**
- Cannot access Skyvern UI at http://localhost/skyvern/
- 404 Not Found errors

**Solutions:**

1. Check if the Skyvern UI container is running:
   ```bash
   docker ps | grep skyvernui
   ```

2. Verify the Skyvern UI is accessible directly:
   ```bash
   curl -I http://localhost:3000/skyvern/
   ```

3. Check Skyvern UI logs:
   ```bash
   docker logs tsautomation-main-skyvernui-1
   ```

4. Verify Nginx configuration for Skyvern UI:
   ```bash
   cat nginx/conf.d/default.conf | grep -A 10 "Skyvern UI"
   ```

### Authentication Issues

#### Authentication Failures

**Symptoms:**
- 401 Unauthorized errors
- 403 Forbidden errors
- Authentication token rejected

**Solutions:**

1. Verify API key or Bearer token:
   ```bash
   # Test with API key
   curl -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key" http://localhost:8000/api/v2/health
   
   # Test with Bearer token
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your-bearer-token" http://localhost:8000/api/v2/health
   ```

2. Check environment variables:
   ```bash
   grep -E "SKYVERN_API_KEY|SKYVERN_BEARER_TOKEN" .env
   ```

3. Verify token expiration:
   ```bash
   # For JWT tokens, decode and check expiration
   echo "your-token" | cut -d. -f2 | base64 -d 2>/dev/null | jq .exp
   ```

4. Restart authentication service:
   ```bash
   docker-compose restart skyvern
   ```

   - Successfully tested task creation and retrieval

3. **Fixed Skyvern UI Access**:
   - Corrected the UI path mapping to properly serve content from `/skyvern/` path
